OPrime_Cipher
=============

Version of Caesar cipher that uses the sum of circular primes below the given key to decrypt the given message.

=============

Java program that simulates a circular primes decryption device.

Unlike a regular Caesar cipher, this version uses the key as its circular prime upper limit.

This limit is used to calculate the sum of positive circular primes below it.

The calculated sum is then used as the shift number to decrypt the message.

=============

Based on problem 35 on projecteuler.net, and the Caesar Cipher.
